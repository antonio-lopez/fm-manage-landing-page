## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) - Open-source component library built around Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Creating a carousel by hand was complicated given the fact I was working with Tailwind CSS. Luckily I found a library that comes with built in components that can be configured to one's needs. Adding my testimonial cards inside the carousel was easy enough.

```
<div
	data-carousel-item=''
	className='stlying configuration'
>
// testimonial card
</div>
```

Styling the carousel was the challenging part and couldn't replicate the sample design.

### Useful resources

- [Flowbite Carousel Docs](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/carousel/) - This helped me configure the carousel and add the testimonials section
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The official Tailwind CSS documentation
